<h2>Cryptography-Machine</h2>
Cryptography in cybersecurity is the practice of securing information and communications through use of codes.

<h2>Description</h2>
This program is a simple python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt their messages. Firstly, two strings were created to store keys and the values of lowercase alphabets. Then, two dicts were created which are <B>enccryptDict</B> and <B>decryptDict</B>. After that user was allowed to choose their mode of communication through the input module. Once the user chooses the mode of communication and the input is accepted, then the message is either encrypted or decrypted according to their mode of communication, and finally the result is printed. While <B>enccryptDict</B> was being created first the keys and then the value were passed and vice-versa was performed for <B>decryptDict</B>. Here only lowers alpahbets are passed as keys so the message to be encrypted is passed in lower case and decrypted message is also printed in lowercase.
