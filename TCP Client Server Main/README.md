<h2>TCP Client and Server</h2>

In this project, I created a simple TCP client and server to demonstrate the use of sockets and related parameters like ``SOCK_INET`` and ``SOCK_STREAM`` using Python. To initiate the connection, I had to gain root privilege so I ran python file using ``sudo`` command.
